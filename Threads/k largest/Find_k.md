###Find k of n

##Example task of parallelizing a sorting algorithm
#Main: Find_k.java

The main principle of this program is to find and sort the k largest numbers
out of an array of size n.
This task is based on an obligatory assignment in a UiO course, and the
motivation is to introduce the difference in performance of Java util's .sort
method and a sequential and a parallel sorting algorithm.
